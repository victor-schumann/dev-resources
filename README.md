<details><summary>6. Author's comments</summary>

Well in terms of interview prep - those books just work. I very seriously reread them anytime I'm going into a round of technical interviews. (It's more of skimming and refreshing now because I've read them all before). Combined with doing practice problems (Code Complete) they will get you ready to get a job.

In terms of the rest of them I think there are a few different benefits that you get:

1.  It helps you understand your coworkers thinking and communicate better with them. There are memes (in the Richard Dawkins sense) that spread throughout the software engineering world. Some of the books on my list (_Clean Code_, _The Pragmatic Programmer_, Martin Fowler's stuff, and more) are on the list not because they're revolutionary or will completely change the way you think or code. They're on the list because many if not most developers working professionally have read them. Having that common context allows you to both better understand where your peers are coming from and speak to them in a language they'll understand.
    
2.  It gives you a set of 'tools' to use to solve common problems and explain concepts. The books don't completely shift your way of thinking (unless you're very new to programming). They do however refine your pattern matching abilities and give you a wide array of viewpoints from which to approach a problem. I've found them especially helpful when I need to explain a concept to others. Having read about it in a book (often multiple books) I'm able to explain it with a much greater clarity than I could if I have learned it organically.
    
3.  Of course, there **are** new concepts you learn in the books. The first time I read about dependency inversion was in a book for instance. That became a super useful skill to have when I was in my first job.
    
4.  They break you out of religious wars and dogma. I find many programmers, especially young ones, have strong opinions about the 'right' way to make software. Of course, even senior developers can be dogmatic (looking at you 'software craftsmanship' movement, TDD zealots, and 'agile' consultants). One of the reasons I list the 'Specialist Skills' section is that by seeing examples from many languages and technologies you'll stop thinking there's one 'right' way to make software and start thinking, what's the best tool for this task?
    
5.  You'll understand which problems and intractable and why things are the way they are today. This is particularly geared towards the history section of the lists but true of the others as well. Knowing whether you're dealing with the same thing a million others have (and nobody has figured out a good answer to) can be helpful and time-saving.
    
6.  You see problems before they happen and develop a '6th sense' for bad code.
